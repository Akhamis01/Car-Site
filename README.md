# Car Brochure Website

Simple Website that describes one of my favourite cars, the Lamborghini Huracan

The "index.html" contains the landing page of my website, and provides access to the other three '.html' files from the navigation bar.

In the "models.html" file, I put some dummy text ("Lorem Ipsum") in the place where I would describe each Huracan Model. This is not the actual description of each model, it's just a placeholder for the actual description.
