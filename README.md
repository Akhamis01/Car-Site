# Project 0
Web Programming with Python and JavaScript:

In project0, I made a website that describes one of my favourite cars, the Lamborghini Huracan. All requirements of the project have been met.

The "index.html" contains the landing page of my website, and provides access to the other three '.html' files from the navigation bar.

In the "models.html" file, I put some dummy text ("Lorem Ipsum") in the place where I would describe each Huracan Model. This is not the actual description of each model, it's just a placeholder for the actual description.
Also, in the "contact.html" file, the "Send Form" button does not work, it's just a design. Also, the links in the footers do not work.
